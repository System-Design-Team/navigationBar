<b>System Design Capstone</b>

Milestones I completed during this project:
1. Generated 10M rows of records in a CSV to seed DB
2. Uploaded data to Postgres DB
3. Uploaded data to Mongo DB
4. With MongoDB, got my queries running in under 50ms. Usually 5-10ms.
5. I installed New Relic, and stress tested the service locally with Artillery.
6. I deployed my service to an AWS EC2 instance using Docker.
